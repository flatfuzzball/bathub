# bathub
simple github frontend made as a learning project (which means its pretty bad).

it's written with python and flask.

don't think it's too resource efficient or fast, so you probably don't want to host it but please do so if you wish, as long as you send me a link so i can add it here.

currently does not support displaying gists, only users, repos, tags, releases and source trees.
